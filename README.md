# Hey ppl

This is my trial at creating webpages and learning web development. This is most likely my experimental ground so most of the times the webpage can be weird and deformed. But trust me, it is going under many many things i learn everyday. as of now, i've learnt a lot about flex, and it helps in many ways. should use it more often to know about it!!
